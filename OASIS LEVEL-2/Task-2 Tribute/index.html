          <h2>A Mathematical Genius</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Srinivasa Ramanujan</b> (22 December 1887 â€“ 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who made substantial contributions to the field of mathematics, especially in the areas of number theory, analysis, and continued fractions. Despite having no formal training in mathematics, Ramanujan independently discovered many new theorems and conjectures that continue to be studied and applied in modern mathematics.

            <h2>Childhood and Education</h2>
            <p>
                Ramanujan was born in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, to a Tamil Brahmin family. His father worked as a clerk in a cloth merchant's shop. From a young age, Ramanujan showed an extraordinary aptitude for mathematics, often solving complex problems without any formal training.

                In 1909, Ramanujan obtained a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam, but he lost the scholarship the following year due to his focus on mathematics instead of his other subjects. He continued to study and make new discoveries on his own, and in 1911, he sent a letter with some of his theorems to the English mathematician G.H. Hardy, who recognized his talent and invited him to study at Cambridge University in England.
